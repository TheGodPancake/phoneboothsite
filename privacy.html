        <p>Welcome to PhoneBooth!

Your privacy is of utmost importance to us. This Privacy Policy details how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information while you interact with our bot, PhoneBooth, on Discord. We urge you to read this policy carefully. By continuing to use PhoneBooth, you acknowledge and agree to the collection and use of your information as described herein. If you do not agree with these terms, please discontinue use of the bot.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>We only collect the necessary information to provide and improve the service:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User ID:</strong> The unique identifier assigned to you by Discord, used to manage calls and cross-server communication. We store User IDs only if a message is reported. This data is kept for up to 30 days and deleted once the report is resolved or escalated.</li>
                <li><strong>User Name, Server Nickname, and Display Name:</strong> Your Discord name is used during calls for identification purposes. This information is sent via webhooks and is only stored if a message is reported.</li>
                <li><strong>Avatar Image:</strong> Your Discord avatar is used during calls for identification purposes and to ensure no inappropriate avatar images are involved. It is also used to provide a good user experience. This data is only stored if a user reports a message and will be deleted within 30 days after the report is resolved or escalated.</li>
                <li><strong>In-Call Messages:</strong> Messages sent during calls are transmitted to the connected server for communication. These messages are processed in real-time during calls but are not stored beyond the duration of the call unless reported. The message will only be stored if the user reports the message. Reported messages are retained for up to 30 days before being permanently deleted.</li>
                <li><strong>Server Name and Server Image:</strong> For servers that appear in the top 10 most active servers leaderboard (accessible via the c.leaderboard command), we collect and store the server name and server image/icon. This information will be publicly displayed in the top 10 leaderboard to showcase server activity rankings and highlight which servers have the most active PhoneBooth usage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not collect any other information beyond what is stated here.</p>
